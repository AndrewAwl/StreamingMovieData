# StreamingMovieData

Goal
To understand the movies available on some of the big streaming platformsThere is a dataset that looks at movies found on some of the big streaming platforms, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney +. I may try to find a movie recommendation or two based on average ratings maybe in a couple of categories that I have not seen already. If I am able to I will try to tie this dataset to the IMDB dataset (2nd link), and also have a list of separately tracked movies I’ve watched (did not attach but can here) via icheckmovies.com that has imdb links so can link to that as well to rule out movies I’ve already seen.
Questions to investigate
·        What is the average rating of a movie on each platform?
·        What has the highest # of quality films (need to set a benchmark for what I think that is)
·        What has the highest # of low quality films
·        Want to also try to link this to the IMDB data, that can get trickier to link the data, maybe by name - year - director? To maybe look at demographics of the ratings
·        how many movies appear on multiple platforms, are there any that appear on all 4? This is a bit more unlikely due to the nature of content on Disney+ compared to the other 3
·        What is the age of the films on the streaming platforms? Can produce this graphically
·        Look at some of these cuts by category (will have to pull out unique categories as many of the films are listed as multiple categories)
·        If able to tie last part of data together with movies watched, will see what have I watched the most of services wise, what have I watched the least of (and would be able to find most new content)
·        What are the highest rated movies on each service that I have not watched yet? Might also be able to pull in IMDB Top100 list here
Limitations of data
Don’t know how this data was pulled so hopefully it is trustworthy, it is a bit stale (8 months) so not sure if all of the movies are relevant, will not account for some newer items
Based on comments this is based on streaming available in USA region only
Streaming dataset does not have an IMDB link so will have to figure out how to link data to IMDB, especially given potential overlap of titles throughout the years (Movie name – Director – Year?)
